        <h1>We are Senior High School students</h1>
        <p>This project came to light because of our passion for connecting with one another. The team behind the H.K. Project are Cameron Drew Belleza, Jarius Daniel Calay, Elle Delizo, Marielle Encina, Sabrina W. Fernandez and Patricia Anne Dela Merced.

        <h2>How We Plan to Help</h2>
        <p>Many people, especially with this pandemic going on in 2020, left people yearning for having connections with others. In view of the fact that social distancing and staying in became the new norm, people rely on social media to connect with others. However, turning to social media can expose us to toxicity because of its addictive and unhealthy nature.<br></br>
        With the Hawak Kamay Project, we as a team, are attempting to make the connecting experience less toxic by allowing you to share your emotions anonymously, in real time where eveyone can view. Sure, this can be done on the social media platforms but it is hard to connect to others if you plan on staying anonymous. Usually when one starts a social media, they add their friends, but what if you want to start from scratch and meet new people? It is a lot harder reach users in that you have to search up their usernames, but here, everyone is on one platform only. You do not have the algorithm forcing you to watch certain things.</p>
